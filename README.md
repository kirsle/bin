Kirsle's Shell Scripts
======================

These are various shell scripts (mostly Perl) that I wrote to accomplish
various personal tasks. Others may find some of them useful. Feel free to
browse around.

All the scripts have commented headers briefly describing what the script
does and how to use it.
